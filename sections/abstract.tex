There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom
setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science,
as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum.
These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for
teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual
knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills.
Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments
provide an attractive opportunity to improve the efficiency and ease with which students
can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using
commonly-available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure
support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover
the benefits (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of
relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to
make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and
improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.
